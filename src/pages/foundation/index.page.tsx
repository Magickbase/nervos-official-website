        We see the Nervos Network as an open bazaar. Anyone can come by and participate in the network at any level. In
        a bazaar-style open market, all types of participants are welcome: no matter if you’re a builder, contributor or
        just an observer.

        The market itself is little more than a roof over an empty space, but by providing a common meeting ground where
        independent participants act on their own motivations, a responsive, vibrant environment emerges where the
        breadth of human creativity can bloom.

        With an open approach, there are no rules about what kind of applications you can build on it, and we believe
        true innovation can be explored and a platform will be created where interesting new projects can grow with the
